To install just copy the APK located at /app/release to your device and install it!

Once opened it's very simple. Just give the app permission to get your location and make sure you have access to the Internet.

The list will be populated with the restaurants nearby. Touch them to open them in Google Maps. A Longpress will add them to your favourites so you don't need Internet to revisit them.
# 
This app uses the Zomato API to get the restaurants nearby and calculates the distance to them in a straight line.

In the menu bar it will show the location near you where Zomato has restaurant information.
# 
App is in English and Portuguese (Portugal)

Tested on Android 10 (emulator) and Android 6.0 (real device).
